## Match Review

Barca tied with Inter Milan 1-1 in the champion league game. Time was runing out for Barca but Malcom came to the rescue. Assist by Countinho, Malcom scored at the 82th minute. He celebrate it with tears as he scored he first goal for Barca! But the game was not over. After 4 minutes later, Icardi scored to draw a tie against Barca! The final whistle blows and neither of the team score another goal to win. Next time Barca!
