## *Match Review*

With our star, Messi, being back in the squad we still end up losing. It was a thrill game as both team show they have goals in them. We were already losing 2-0 in the first half. But Barca did not give up! Jordi Alba foul earn Barca a penalty scored by Messi! Ter Stegen accident mistake made the score 3-1. Arturo Vidal came on the field and score a goal! A misstime slide tackle made by Rakitic cause him to get a red card. Minutes pass when Real Betis scored again which made the score 4-2! Barca are surely in big trouble as time was runing. Messi scored the 91th minute but the final whistle blowed and it was all over for Barca! It ended up Barca 3-4 Real Betis. We got this next time Barca!
