## Why get it?

This cleat in my opnion is one of the best cleats I used! The boot comes with an extra grip for the ball. It is really likable for putting masterpiece passes and adding curves on the ball. If your the type of people who like to dribble and control the ball I recommend this cleat to to it firm grip on the ball! Overall, this boot looks nice and feels nice. 

## *Pro*

*1. Many different color*

*2. Pro footballers like Kevin De Bruyne and Coutinho wears it*

*3. One of the newest and popular cleats*

*4. Can control the ball really well*

*5. One of the best hightops cleats*

### *Cons*

*In my opinion, it's hard for me to used this cleats on turf. That's probably just the con about this cleats.*
